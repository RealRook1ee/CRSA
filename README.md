# CRSA

CRSA is a Chinese single-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset focused on **airline ticket booking**. It contains **1,480** dialogue sessions and **12,136** utterances. The dataset supports fine-grained annotations over dialogue acts, slot values, task phases, user anomalies, and system control strategies. All dialogues follow a multi-turn, system-led task progression structure. CRSA offers a robust benchmark for training controllable, adaptive, and context-aware TOD systems.

Details are available in our EMNLP 2025 submission (currently under review).

## ðŸ§° Annotation Protocols

We provide structured annotation protocols (Appendix A of our paper), including:

- `annotation_guidelines/system_guideline.md`: System-side behavior and flow control rules
- `annotation_guidelines/user_guideline.md`: User-side expression and task goal guidance
- `annotation_guidelines/anomaly_definitions.md`: Six types of user anomalies and system response strategies

## ðŸ“Š Data

In `data/` directory. CRSA data includes JSON-formatted files: `train.json`, `valid.json`, `test.json`.

Data statistics:

| Split    | Dialogues | Turns  | Avg. Turns | Avg. Slots | Avg. Values |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Train    | 1,100     | ~9,000 | 17.5       | 15         | 1670        |

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal Types and Statistics

We define different dialogue types based on user behavior and goal structure:

| Type                  | Count | Goal Change Rate | Anomaly Rate | Avg. Sub-goals | Avg. Dialog Acts | Avg. Turns |
|-----------------------|-------|------------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Simple                | 352   | 0.12             | 0.15         | 1.2            | 2.1              | 12.6       |
| Multi-intent          | 480   | 0.28             | 0.19         | 2.7            | 2.4              | 17.3       |
| Multi-intent+Anomaly  | 648   | 0.34             | 0.31         | 3.1            | 2.7              | 21.2       |

## ðŸ“‚ Data Format

Each annotated dialogue consists of the following structure:

### ðŸ”¹ `Context`

Stores structured multi-turn history of the dialogue, segmented into phases:

- `basic_information`: early slot-filling (e.g. departure, destination, date)
- `ticket_selection`: option listing, user preferences, user selection
- `booking_information`: personal details for ticket booking
- `utterances`: list of system/user utterances within each phase
- `slots`: all accumulated slot values (e.g., `departure_time`, `price`)
- `ticket_options`: candidate flights (in selection phase)
- `user_choice`: the final chosen option (if any)
- `current_step`: boolean indicating whether a phase is ongoing

### ðŸ”¹ `Dialogue`

Captures the **last system-user interaction** with intent-level annotation:

- `agenda`: the system's utterance, decomposed into:
  - `statements`: factual content
  - `question`: system inquiry
  - `current_step`: the dialogue phase
- `user`: the user reply, with:
  - `utterances`: user natural utterance
  - `anomaly_analysis`:
    - `has_anomaly`: whether an anomaly exists
    - `anomaly_reason`: type of anomaly (e.g., Irrelevant_demand)
    - `system_Dialogue_action`: expected system action response

### ðŸ”¹ `Slots`

Final extracted task-relevant information for the session.
CRSA defines 15 task-relevant slot types to support comprehensive user intents and booking constraints. Each slot captures a specific aspect of the user's goal in airline ticket booking.Below are the slot definitions:

| Slot Name         | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `departure`       | Departure city or location from which the user wishes to fly             |
| `destination`     | Target city or location to which the user wants to travel                |
| `departure_time`  | Preferred date and/or time of departure                                  |
| `flight_duration` | Estimated or preferred duration of the flight                            |
| `airport`         | Specific airport name or preference                                      |
| `price`           | Price constraints                                                        |
| `cabin`           | Preferred cabin class                                                    |
| `transit`         | Whether the user prefers direct flights or allows transfer               |
| `airlines`        | Preferred airline or carrier                                             |
| `seat_type`       | Preferred seat location                                                  |
| `meal`            | Whether the flight should include onboard meals                          |
| `baggage`         | Free luggage allowance requirements or expectations                      |
| `discount`        | User's concern or eligibility regarding discounts                        |
| `round_trip`      | Whether the user requires a round-trip booking                           |
| `personal_info`   | User's personal booking information                                      |
